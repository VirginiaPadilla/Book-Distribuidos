  abstract  = {Predictive environmental sensor networks provide complex engineering and systems challenges. These systems must withstand the event of interest, remain functional over long time periods when no events occur, cover large geographical regions of interest to the event, and support the variety of sensor types needed to detect the phenomenon. Prediction of the phenomenon on the network complicates the system further, requiring additional computation on themicrocontrollers and utilizing prediction models that are not typically designed for sensor networks. This paper describes a system architecture and deployment to meet the design requirements and to allow model-driven control, thereby optimizing the prediction capability of the system. We explore the application of river flood prediction using this architecture, describing our work on a centralized form of the prediction model, network implementation, component testing and infrastructure development in Honduras, deployment on a river in Massachusetts, and results of the field experiments. Our system uses only a small number of nodes to cover basins of 1000-10000 square km2 using an unique heterogeneous communication structure to provide real-time sensed data, incorporating self-monitoring for failure, and adapting measurement schedules to capture events of interest.},

  abstract   = {A fundamental problem that confronts peer-to-peer applications is to efficiently locate the node that stores a particular data item. This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.},

  abstract  = {Gossip-based algorithms were first introduced for reliably disseminating data in large-scale distributed systems. However, their simplicity, robustness, and flexibility make them attractive for more than just pure data dissemination alone. In particular, gossiping has been applied to data aggregation, overlay maintenance, and resource allocation. Gossiping applications more or less fit the same framework, with often subtle differences in algorithmic details determining divergent emergent behavior. This divergence is often difficult to understand, as formal models have yet to be developed that can capture the full design space of gossiping solutions. In this paper, we present a brief introduction to the field of gossiping in distributed systems, by providing a simple framework and using that framework to describe solutions for various application domains.},

The algorithm requires at most N message exchanges for one mutual exclusion invocation.

A drawback of the algorithm is that the sequence numbers contained in the messages are unbounded. It is shown that this problem can be overcome by slightly increasing the number of message exchanges.},

  year     = {1982},
  month    = jul,
  pages    = {382-401},
  abstract = {I have long felt that, because it was posed as a cute problem about philosophers seated around a table, Dijkstra's dining philosopher's problem received much more attention than it deserves. (For example, it has probably received more attention in the theory community than the readers/writers problem, which illustrates the same principles and has much more practical importance.) I believed that the problem introduced in [41] was very important and deserved the attention of computer scientists. The popularity of the dining philosophers problem taught me that the best way to attract attention to a problem is to present it in terms of a story.

There is a problem in distributed computing that is sometimes called the Chinese Generals Problem, in which two generals have to come to a common agreement on whether to attack or retreat, but can communicate only by sending messengers who might never arrive. I stole the idea of the generals and posed the problem in terms of a group of generals, some of whom may be traitors, who have to reach a common decision. I wanted to assign the generals a nationality that would not offend any readers. At the time, Albania was a completely closed society, and I felt it unlikely that there would be any Albanians around to object, so the original title of this paper was The Albanian Generals Problem. Jack Goldberg was smart enough to realize that there were Albanians in the world outside Albania, and Albania might not always be a black hole, so he suggested that I find another name. The obviously more appropriate Byzantine generals then occurred to me.

The main reason for writing this paper was to assign the new name to the problem. But a new paper needed new results as well. I came up with a simpler way to describe the general 3n+1-processor algorithm. (Shostak's 4-processor algorithm was subtle but easy to understand; Pease's generalization was a remarkable tour de force.) We also added a generalization to networks that were not completely connected. (I don't remember whose work that was.) I also added some discussion of practical implementation details.},

Today the traffic caused by Peer-to-Peer networks represents a significant portion in the Internet. For example in the German Research Network (Deutsches Forschungsnetz DFN) Peer-to-Peer causes up to 60 percent of the traffic [210]. Similar trends can be observed in other networks e.g. in the Abilene backbone [42].},

  abstract  = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks appeared roughly around the year 2000 when a broadband Internet infrastructure (even at the network edge) became widely available. Other than traditional networks Peer-to-Peer networks do not rely on a specific infrastructure offering transport services. Instead they form ``overlay structures'' focusing on content allocation and distribution based on TCP or HTTP connections. Whereas in a standard Client-Server configuration content is stored and provided only via some central server(s), Peer-to-Peer networks are highly decentralized and locate a desired content at some participating peer and provide the corresponding IP address of that peer to the searching peer. The download of that content is then initiated using a separate connection, often using HTTP. Thus, the high load usually resulting for a central server and its surrounding network is avoided leading to a more even distribution of load on the underlying physical network. On the other hand, such networks are typically subject to frequent changes because peers join and leave the network without any central control.},

Applications, such as instant messaging, file-sharing, and content distribution have attracted countless numbers of users. For example, Skype gained more than 2.5 millions of users within twelve months, and more than 50{\%} of Internet traffic is originated by BitTorrent. These very large and still rapidly growing systems attest to a new era for the design and deployment of distributed systems [52]. In particular, they reflect what the major challenges are today for designing and implementing distributed systems: scalability, flexibility, and instant deployment.},

Freenet operates as a network of identical nodes that collectively pool their storage space to store data files and cooperate to route requests to the most likely physical location of data. No broadcast search or centralized location index is employed. Files are referred to in a location-independent manner, and are dynamically replicated in locations near requestors and deleted from locations where there is no interest. It is infeasible to discover the true origin or destination of a file passing through the network, and dificult for a node operator to determine or be held responsible for the actual physical contents of her own node.},

  abstract  = {A fundamental problem with many peer-to-peer systems is the tendency for users to "free ride"--to consume resources without contributing to the system. The popular file distribution tool BitTorrent was explicitly designed to address this problem, using a tit-for-tat reciprocity strategy to provide positive incentives for nodes to contribute resources to the swarm. While BitTorrent has been extremely successful, we show that its incentive mechanism is not robust to strategic clients. Through performance modeling parameterized by real world traces, we demonstrate that all peers contribute resources that do not directly improve their performance. We use these results to drive the design and implementation of BitTyrant, a strategic BitTorrent client that provides a median 70\% performance gain for a 1 Mbit client on live Internet swarms. We further show that when applied universally, strategic clients can hurt average per-swarm performance compared to today's BitTorrent client implementations.},

  abstract  = {A core area of P2P systems research is the topology of the overlay network. It has ranged from random unstructured networks like Gnutella to Super-Peer architectures to the recent trend of structured overlays based on distributed hash tables (DHTs) (I. Stoica et al., 2001), (A. Rowstron et al., 2001), (S. Ratnasamy et al., 2001). While the unstructured networks have excessive lookup costs and un-guaranteed lookups, the structured systems offer no anonymity and delegate control over data items to unrelated peers. We present an in-the-middle hybrid architecture which uses a mix of both topologies to create a decentralized P2P infrastructure. The system provides scalable and guaranteed lookups in addition to mutual anonymity and also allows hosting content with the content-owner. We validate our architecture through a thorough analytical and performance analysis of the system.},

  abstract  = {Over the Internet today, there has been much interest in emerging Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks because they provide a good substrate for creating data sharing, content distribution, and application layer multicast applications. There are two classes of P2P overlay networks: structured and unstructured. Structured networks can efficiently locate items, but the searching process is not user friendly. Conversely, unstructured networks have efficient mechanisms to search for a content, but the lookup process does not take advantage of the distributed system nature. In this paper, we propose a hybrid structured and unstructured topology in order to take advantages of both kind of networks. In addition, our proposal guarantees that if a content is at any place in the network, it will be reachable with probability one. Simulation results show that the behaviour of the network is stable and that the network distributes the contents efficiently to avoid network congestion.},
